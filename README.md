# Crafting Dead
Crafting Dead is a multiplayer based modpack that puts you into a zombie apocalypse. Explore, create a base and fend off endless hordes of zombies. The mod completely changes the way you look at Minecraft. Customize your character with backpacks, clothing, tactical vests and guns. Our guns are fully customizable with attachments and paints! Crafting Dead has been around for over six years now and is still constantly evolving.

# Contributing
Pull requests are always welcome, however please adhere to the following guidlines:
* Use the [Google style guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)
* Add `@Override` annotations where appropriate to make overrides explicitly clear
* Rename semi-obfuscated variables (e.g. p_77624_1_) to meaningful names
* Turn on compiler warnings; resolve all of them (raw types, resource leaks, unused imports, unused variables etc.)
* Always use `this` keyword to make code as clear/readable as possible and to avoid ambiguous naming conflicts (which can go without notice)
* Always use curly braces `{}` around if statements to make them clearer and easily expandable, e.g. 
```java
if(foo) {
  bar();
}
```
instead of 
```java
if(foo)
  bar();
```
